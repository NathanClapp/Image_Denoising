# Image_Denoising
This is an implementation of an image de-noising GAN on Keras/Tensorflow, using the Renoir dataset. It's also my first attempt at making a GAN! The idea here is for me to learn the fundamentals of advanced neural networks by coding my impressions of conceptual articles and research papers.

#Dataset Info:
Link to dataset: https://ani.stat.fsu.edu/~abarbu/Renoir.html
My initial plan is to use the Canon T3i raw data. I'll record the quality of results (possibly using the provided PSNR tool) here or in a notebook.
